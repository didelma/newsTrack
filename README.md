# NewsTrack

"newsTrack" is a web app where users can browse news from all around the nation based on geography. The data/information will be displayed to the users via flash cards on the screen. The flash cards will show random news headlines in a random order every time the site is refresed and each care will have a state name to indicate the origin of publication/reports. A user will be able to swipe between flash cards to view information from different states if they'd like to and by clicking on the news headline the user will be taken to the source of the full article.
